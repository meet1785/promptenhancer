# 🔑 PERMANENT API CONFIGURATION GUIDE

## ✅ Your Gemini API Key is Now Hardcoded!

Your RACCO Prompt Enhancer extension is now permanently configured with your Gemini API key. **You never need to enter it again!**

### 🎯 What's Configured:

```javascript
PROVIDER: "gemini"
API_KEY: "AIzaSyDPTCBHf4dE9V02GkvoAjIIu-d2V-3Eg0M" // Your key (hardcoded)
MODEL: "gemini-2.5-flash"
ENDPOINT: Google Generative Language API
USER_OVERRIDES: DISABLED // Permanent configuration only
```

### 🚀 How It Works:

1. **Install Extension** → Works immediately with Gemini
2. **No Setup Required** → API key is built into the code  
3. **Click "Enhance"** → Uses your Gemini API automatically
4. **No Popup Configuration** → Everything is permanent

### 🧪 Testing:

1. Install the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Go to any website with text inputs  
3. Type a prompt (e.g., "Write a blog post")
4. Click the "Enhance" button that appears
5. Watch your prompt get enhanced by Gemini AI!

### 📋 Files Updated:

- ✅ **background.js** → Gemini API key hardcoded
- ✅ **popup.html** → Shows permanent config status
- ✅ **popup.js** → Disabled user input fields
- ✅ **All API calls** → Route to your Gemini account

### 🛡️ Security Notes:

- API key is embedded in extension code
- No user can override or change it
- Works offline (falls back to local enhancement)
- No data stored in browser storage

### 🎉 Benefits:

- **One-time setup** → Set and forget
- **No user confusion** → Just works
- **Consistent experience** → Always uses your Gemini account
- **No lost API keys** → Permanently configured
